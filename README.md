# CodingChallenges
Coding challenges I do to practice for job interviews and just fun in general. 
Currently in the process of transferring completed problem from spreadsheet into GitHub. 

This [spreadsheet][s] contains all solved problems, my personal evaluation of how well I did, and some notes for solving the problem.
